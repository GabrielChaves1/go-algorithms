# Go Algorithms

Personal repository containing my algorithm solutions implemented in Go.
The goal of this project is to:

- Improve logical reasoning
- Learn data structures and problem-solving techniques
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Track my progress as a Go developer

The solutions are organized by categories (arrays, strings, DP, graphs, etc.).
Some of them include simple tests using `testing` and `reflect`.

Each algorithm has its own `.go` file.
Some directories may also contain `_test.go` files with unit tests.

## How to Run the Tests

To run all tests in the repository:

```bash
go test ./...
```

or

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

```

```
